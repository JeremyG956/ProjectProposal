# HP Business Analyst Project Proposal

# Introduction
In the fast-paced and competitive landscape of today's business world, the ability to swiftly respond to emerging challenges and identify areas for improvement is crucial for any company aiming to gain a competitive advantage. As businesses consider undertaking new projects, they must navigate the delicate balance between time, money, and opportunity. Consequently, a data-driven approach becomes essential, with quantifiable results serving as the underlying foundation for decision-making. 

Effective project execution requires meticulous attention to detail, encompassing a comprehensive understanding of the project's purpose, budgetary considerations, timeline, and a clear vision of the desired system functionality. By providing developers with precise specifications, companies can ensure that the resulting projects precisely meet their unique needs.

A critical aspect of successful project management lies in building a repository of valuable business knowledge. This repository becomes an asset of immense value, allowing future project teams to leverage previous decision-making processes and build upon existing initiatives.

In this project, I played the role of an HP Business Analytics team member, and we were presented with a pressing challenge. The company's ticketing software was lagging behind the inventory system, leading to users ordering PCs with unavailable parts. This backlog of tickets resulted in canceled orders and significant financial losses. Our project sponsor, Kathy Thompson, the senior director of the new product integration team, estimated an annual cost of approximately $250,000 USD, with projections of a 10% year-on-year increase if the issue was not resolved. As we delved deeper into the project's implications, we recognized that there was more at stake than just the direct financial cost. We acknowledged the importance of considering the business reputation and the impact on customer retention. In a competitive market, maintaining customer loyalty is paramount, and the cost of keeping a satisfied customer is often far less than the expense of acquiring new ones.

To address this issue, Kathy tasked us with creating a data-driven proposal to justify a new project that will fix the currently broken ticketing system. Our primary goal was to assess the financial viability of the project, weighing the three critical cost trade-offs: time, money, and opportunity. Additionally, we sought to establish a comprehensive data archive that would serve as a valuable resource for the business's future endeavors.

Through rigorous analysis and data-driven decision-making, we aimed to determine whether the project warranted pursuit and how it could yield significant benefits for the company's future growth and success.â€ƒ

# Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to address and resolve the existing issues with the ticketing system, which is currently not meeting the organization's operational needs. To achieve this, the project will be strategically approached with a strong emphasis on data-driven decision-making, ensuring that all proposed solutions are well-founded and aligned with the company's goals.

The project will encompass several key deliverables, each playing a crucial role in analyzing and designing an effective solution. These deliverables include:

1.	Feasibility Report: A comprehensive assessment of the project's viability, considering technical, economic, operational, and scheduling aspects.
2.	Formal Project Proposal: A detailed proposal outlining the project's scope, objectives, expected outcomes, resource requirements, and estimated timeline.
3.	Work Breakdown Structures: A structured breakdown of tasks and activities, providing a clear schedule and project roadmap.
4.	Event Response Map: A visual representation of potential events and their corresponding responses within the system, enabling proactive planning for system behavior.
5.	Context Diagrams: Utilizing an outside-in approach, context diagrams will highlight interactions and actions taken by users and the system, capturing the overall system complexity.
6.	Data Flow Diagrams: Visual representations of data movement and processing within the system, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of information flows.

After a thorough evaluation of the project, a project development methodology will be determined to get the project completed within a 6-month period.
